# Nifty50 Algo Trading Strategy

An end-to-end algorithmic trading project built using Python. This project demonstrates technical analysis, strategy design, backtesting, and performance evaluation, designed with a strong focus on analytical and coding skills applicable to quantitative finance roles like Barclays Global Markets & Equity Research.

---

## Project Overview

This project explores the development of rule-based trading strategies using technical indicators (MACD, RSI, SMA). We work with historical stock data of the Nifty50 constituents (India’s benchmark index), clean and engineer features, implement strategies, backtest them, and analyze risk-adjusted returns.

---

## Core Objectives

- Apply financial technical analysis to historical equity data
- Engineer indicators (MACD, RSI, SMA-20/50, Bollinger Bands)
- Build modular trading logic in Python using signal rules
- Backtest across 20+ Nifty stocks from 2018–2023
- Evaluate the Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and total return
- Visualise portfolio performance

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TA-Lib / `ta`)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Yahoo Finance API via `yfinance`
- Modularised strategy functions
- Google Colab & GitHub

## Sample Strategy Logic

```python
# Buy Signal: MACD crosses above MACD Signal AND RSI below 30
df.loc[(df["MACD"] > df["MACD_Signal"]) & (df["RSI"] < 30), "Signal"] = 1

# Sell Signal: MACD crosses below MACD Signal AND RSI above 70
df.loc[(df["MACD"] < df["MACD_Signal"]) & (df["RSI"] > 70), "Signal"] = -1
```
